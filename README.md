# This is Third Submission 3D Shooter Game 

## Introduction

Hey teacher! I'm Mam Sovanratana, and I'm in E4. I'm working on a resume project, focusing on the interaction and mission quest systems (sections 9-16).
If you're not sure about what I'm up to, you can always check my stuff.

## Important

To run the project game, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download unity hub from the browser
2. Install the editor using Unity LTS ( Long Term Support)
3. Open the project and wait for it to load
4. Go to the 'Scenes' folder and open SampleScene.



That's it. Enjoy running the game!!
